Agenda:
* Loading datasets
* Splitting dataset
* Preprocessing
    * Encoding variables into 
    * Intro to Estimators interface
    * Feature scalling
* Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
    * Intro & Application to SVMs
    * Plotting
* Model Evaluation
    * Evaluation metrics
    * Naive evaluation
    * K-fold evaluation with hyperparameter grid search


A few words before starting:
* I am not an expert in the topic (disclaimer).
* Thanks to Dimis Koimtzoglou for advices during the preparation.
